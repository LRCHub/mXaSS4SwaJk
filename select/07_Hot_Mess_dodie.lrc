[00:10.22] Now what my darlin'? Two years have passed
[00:13.92] God, twenty-seven, still crying in cars
[00:17.74] Stop planning our lives on things that haven't been said
[00:21.51] We're not dead
[00:24.55] Waitin' for the
[00:26.72] Countdown, happy birthday
[00:28.96] Dry-heave, I am not okay
[00:31.04] Brain rot, in a pretty dress
[00:33.99] I'm a hot mess
[00:35.24] Wake up, do the same thing
[00:37.18] Break up, then we're dancing
[00:39.25] Why am I so alright
[00:40.96] To do it again and again?
[00:43.11] I can't fight it, you try driving
[00:47.18] Exit to the end in sight, dear
[00:51.32] Make it ugly, put on a show
[00:55.28] Hack it that I hate you
[00:57.29] So that I can let go
[01:07.12] One more reunion (one more)
[01:08.96] And goodbye again (goodbye again)
[01:10.95] Oh god I'd be lying if I didn't want ten
[01:14.62] Stop drafting replies to things that haven't been said
[01:18.28] He's not dead
[01:21.00] Still waitin' for the
[01:23.88] Countdown, happy new year
[01:25.73] Don't know, I am still unclear
[01:27.92] Where'd I go? Take a fuckin' guess
[01:29.99] I'm a hot mess
[01:32.32] Wake up, do the same thing
[01:34.09] Break up, then we're dancing
[01:36.13] Why am I so alright
[01:37.90] To do it again and again?
[01:40.19] I can't fight it, you try driving
[01:44.12] Exit to the end in sight, dear
[01:48.35] Make it ugly, put on a show
[01:52.13] Hack it that I hate you
[01:53.98] So that I can let go
[01:58.64] Let me let go (let me let go)
[02:02.86] Let me let go (let me let go)
[02:06.79] Let me let go
[02:12.03] I can't fight it, you try driving
[02:16.74] Exit to the end in sight, dear
[02:21.45] Make it ugly, put on a show
[02:25.98] Hack it that I hate you
[02:27.87] So that I can let go
[02:32.76] Let me let go (let me let go)
[02:36.63] Let me let go (let me let go)
